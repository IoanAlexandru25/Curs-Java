Library CRUD app is my final project in the Java programming course for advanced developers from DallesGO. In this project, we developed using JavaFX a CRUD application (created, read, and, update and delete) one used the knowledge gained during the 11 courses (the last course being dedicated to application development).
In this project we used new elements, such as:
a non-relational database (MongoDB)
- encrypted passwords using BCrypt
- design patterns, more specifically we used a proxy to manage unsuccessful login attempts
- JavaFX and Scene Builder for frame making
