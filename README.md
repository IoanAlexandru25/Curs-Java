Library CRUD app is my final project in the Java programming course for advanced developers from DallesGO. In this project, using JavaFX, I have developed a CRUD application (create, read, update and delete), where I used the knowledge gained during the 11 sessions of the course (the last course being dedicated to application development).
In this project we used new elements, such as:

- a non-relational database (MongoDB)
- hashing passwords using BCrypt
- design patterns, more specifically we used a proxy to manage unsuccessful login attempts
- JavaFX and Scene Builder for frame making

This is just a beta version, the final version will be available in the near future.
